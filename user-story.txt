You must translate these two user stories into a functional representation:

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working
To complete this challenge, you will need to:

 Write down all the nouns in the User Stories
 Write down all the verbs in the User Stories
 Draw a table like the one above
 Organise the nouns and verbs into Objects and Messages within the table
 Draw a diagram that shows how your Objects will use Messages to communicate with one another
