READ.ME is important for sharing information about your repo with other developers and catching peoples attention 

"Open source community is growing rapidly. Developers release new open-source projects on GitHub every day. As a result, it’s becoming more and more difficult to get your own project to stand out from the sea of open-source software. However, you can do a few things to increase your chances of grabbing other developer’s attention. One effective and simple technique is putting up a nice-looking and helpful README file.
Your README should be as good as your project. A great README file helps your project to stand out from the sea of open-source software on GitHub.
A README is like the face of your project. It is the first file a person should read when encountering a source tree, and it should be written as a very brief and giving very basic introduction to the software."
